Due: 12.13.17


this is my super super super rough draft to try and just outline what i'm gonna do and the stuff idk how to do

import java.util.*;
public class Binary {
  public static void main(String[] args){
    Integer.parseInt(String, int radix);
    Integer.toBinaryString(sum);

    System.out.println(""); //say something to introduce what i want user to do here
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println(""); //say some more stuff like second set of numbers
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println(""); //ask what we are supposed to do with it
    //then I think i call on some method or something to do what they wanted to do with the two numbers
    //do some more method stuff to try and get it to work
    System.out.println(""); //the answer to the thing they want to happen
    //NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO THIS STUFF - MAYBE WORK WITH CHLOE ON IT

    //considine says that we gonna have to use string, next line and stuff. gotta look it up
    //also vicky is doing something super different so this probably isn't right
  }

  //make some methods here

  //add method
  //subtract method
  //multiply method
  //divide method


}


//if i use an array list need to make sure it is only up to 8 (for the 8 bits)
